# 🚀 Predicting Startup Success with Crunchbase Data

> 🚀 **Best Model Accuracy (Random Forest with SMOTE): 87.9%**


## 📌 Project Overview

As someone transitioning into data science with an interest in the banking and finance sector, I sought to take on a project that combines both business relevance and technical depth. This project focuses on predicting startup success using Crunchbase data. I approached it from three key angles:

- **Regression** to understand funding patterns  
- **Classification** to predict startup outcomes  
- **Clustering** to discover natural groupings among startups

The goal was to determine the factors that increase the likelihood of a startup's success — measured by IPOs, acquisitions, or a combination of both — while incorporating both machine learning techniques and business intelligence.

## 🧰 Code and Resources Used

- **Python Version:** 3.11  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`  
- **Dataset:** An excerpt of a dataset released to the public by Crunchbase

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Filtered out companies younger than 3 years or older than 7 years to reduce noise (from 31,000+ to ~9,400 observations)
- Created a new `status` label:  
  - `Success` = Acquired, IPO, or both  
  - `Failure` = Closed or no exit
- Engineered `number_degrees` from MBA, PhD, MS, and Other
- Dropped columns with high missing values (e.g., `acquired_companies`, `products_number`)
- Handled missing values selectively
- Removed funding outliers (above 99th percentile)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA focused on understanding class balance and numerical relationships:
- **Status Value Counts:** Success vs Failure  
- **Log-Transformed Funding Distribution**  
- **Correlation Heatmap** of numeric variables

## 📈 Regression Modeling

### 🔹 Multiple Linear Regression (Statsmodels)

- Dependent variable: `average_funded`
- Significant predictors: `average_participants`, `number_degrees`, `ipo`
- `offices` and `is_acquired` were not statistically significant

---

### 🔹 Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)

- Repeated regression using Scikit-learn’s `LinearRegression`
- Log-transformed `average_funded` for normality
- Coefficients confirmed the importance of `average_participants` and `ipo`

## 🧪 Classification Modeling

### 🔸 Logistic Regression (Baseline – No SMOTE)

- Initially trained on imbalanced classes
- High overall accuracy but **poor recall for “Success”**
- Ineffective at identifying successful startups

---

### 🔸 Logistic Regression (With SMOTE)

- Used SMOTE to balance the dataset
- Improved recall and precision for the “Success” class
- More reliable at flagging high-potential startups

## 🌲 Random Forest Classification

- Used SMOTE-balanced dataset
- Boosted accuracy from **70.7% to 87%**
- Strong performance across all evaluation metrics

## 🛠️ Hyperparameter Tuning

- Tuned `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split` using `GridSearchCV`
- Slight performance improvement
- Feature importance rankings remained stable

## 📚 Clustering Analysis (KMeans)

For a final unsupervised learning step, I applied **KMeans Clustering** to group startups based on:

- `category_code` (encoded)
- `average_funded`
- `average_participants`

### Steps:
- Scaled all features using `StandardScaler`
- Used the **elbow method** to determine 3 optimal clusters
- Visualized results using 2D scatter plots

### Key Insights:
- Startups in similar sectors tend to attract similar funding amounts
- Higher `average_participants` is associated with higher funding clusters
- These clusters help spot high-potential startups independent of IPO or acquisition status
